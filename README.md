# ciao-the-book
This book is about CIAO – Care Integration and Orchestration - free open source software that allows care ICT systems to route, transform and work
flow information between themselves and NHS England national care ICT services.

This is a work in progress. The current format of a word document with associated graphics in Microsoft Visio will be moved to markdown and JPEGs for assembly
 in to a book using GitBook.
